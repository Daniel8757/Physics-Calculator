# Physics-Calculator
A physics calculator that I made when I first started programming. It calculates the 5 kinematic equations, as well as projectile motion
Note that the code is EXTREMLY inefficient. However, it does work and has a UI which explains the step-by-step procedures

I did the entire UI, the projectile motion, and explanations. 
Projectile Motion keeps acceleration at a constant 9.8m/s^2
Owen Van Dyke else did the 5 kinematic equations
